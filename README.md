Mallika Champaneria is currently pursuing [Master of Architecture](https://arch.gatech.edu/master-architecture) at Georgia Institute of Technology. Following her undergraduate degree in architecture, she gained two years of professional experience working on residential and commercial projects across India and the United States. Her design approach is rooted in a commitment to creating spaces that are contextually grounded, materially responsive and experientially meaningful. Over time, she has developed a passion for sustainable architecture, particularly in exploring how adaptive reuse, environmental performance and emerging technologies can converge to create more responsible and enduring built environments.

She is currently collaborating with the [UMCF](https://www.eddy3d.com/) (Urban Microclimate Foam) team, where she develops geometries and Grasshopper scripts to test simulations and evaluate urban environmental performance. <br><br>
